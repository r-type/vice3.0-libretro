## Default controls

|RetroPad button|Action|
|---|---|
|B|Fire button|
|X|Space|
|L2|Escape (RUN/STOP)|
|R2|Enter (RETURN)|
|Select|Toggle virtual keyboard|

|Keyboard key|Action|
|---|---|
|F11|Toggle virtual keyboard|
|F12|Toggle statusbar|
|RControl|Toggle between joyports|
|End|Reset|

### Virtual keyboard controls
|Button|Action|
|---|---|
|B / Enter|Keypress|
|A|Toggle transparency|
|Y|Toggle ShiftLock|
|Start|Press Return|

Long press for sticky keys. Stickying a third key will replace the second.


## Joyport control via filename

C64 games sometimes use joystick port 1 and sometimes joystick port 2 for player 1. There are several ways to switch ports in this core:
- Use the core option for it: `Quick Menu -> Options -> RetroPad Port`.
- Bring up the virtual keyboard with `Select` button, and press the key labeled `JOY` there.
- Rename your games, eg. `Bruce_Lee_j1.tap` or `Bruce_Lee_(j1).tap` for port 1, and similarly `Bruce_Lee_j2.tap` or `Bruce_Lee_(j2).tap` for port 2.

## M3U support and disk control
When you have a multi disk game, you can use a M3U file to specify each disk of the game and change them from the RetroArch Disk Control interface.

A M3U file is a simple text file with one disk per line (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U).

Example:

Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems).m3u
```
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side A)(Game).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side B)(Surface).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side A)(Dungeon).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side B)(Populace A).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side A)(Populace A).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side B)(Populace A).d64
```
Path can be absolute or relative to the location of the M3U file.

When a game ask for it, you can change the current disk in the RetroArch 'Disk Control' menu:
- Eject the current disk with 'Disk Cycle Tray Status'.
- Select the right disk index.
- Insert the new disk with 'Disk Cycle Tray Status'.

Note: ZIP support is provided by the core, which allows the use of zipped images in M3Us.


## JiffyDOS support

External ROM files required in `system/vice`:

|Filename|Size|MD5|
|---|---|---|
|**JiffyDOS_C64.bin**|8 192|be09394f0576cf81fa8bacf634daf9a2|
|**JiffyDOS_C128.bin**|16 384|cbbd1bbcb5e4fd8046b6030ab71fc021|
|**JiffyDOS_1541-II.bin**|16 384|1b1e985ea5325a1f46eb7fd9681707bf|
|**JiffyDOS_1571_repl310654.bin**|32 768|41c6cc528e9515ffd0ed9b180f8467c0|
|**JiffyDOS_1581.bin**|32 768|20b6885c6dc2d42c38754a365b043d71|


## Command file operation

VICE command line options are supported with RetroArch by by placing the desired command line in a text file with a `.cmd` file extension. The command line format is as documented in the Vice documentation (see http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_6.html).

Using this you can overcome limitations of the GUI and set advanced configurations required for running problematic files. Here are a couple of examples for the xvic core  ...

VIC-20 megacart support:
```
xvic -cartmega /path/to/rom/mega-cart-name.rom
```
VIC-20 games which require specific memory configs such as 8k expansion:
```
xvic -memory 1 /path/to/rom/some-8k-game.d64
```

VIC-20 memory expansion will also be set with filename tags or directory matching: `some game (8k).prg` or `/8k/some game.prg`.

## Build instructions

Remember to run `make clean EMUTYPE=x` when building different EMUTYPEs.

Currently working EMUTYPEs:
- `x64`
- `x64sc`
- `x128`
- `xcbm2`
- `xpet`
- `xplus4`
- `xscpu64`
- `xvic`

### Linux
```
CC=gcc make -j4
```
### Windows
```
make -j4
```
### Win64 (crossbuild)
```
make platform=wincross64 -j4
```
### Android standalone toolchain Build
```
export path to your standalone toolchain like

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/standtc/bin

make platform=androidstc -j4
```
### Android ndk Build
```
cd jni
ndk-build
```

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This release stabilizes and introduces the GTK3 UI as the primary user 
 interface for all major ports. For "lesser" platforms we still have the SDL 
 based interface. All other user interfaces have been removed. RIP

 We are still looking for dedicated maintainers for the Windows- and macOS 
 ports, if you want to help improving these and/or want to provide binaries, 
 please get in touch.
