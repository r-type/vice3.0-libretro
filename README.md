Long press for sticky keys. Stickying the third key will replace the second.

## Joyport control

Older C64 games tend to use joystick port 1 and newer ones tend to use port 2 for player 1. There are several ways to switch ports in this core:

- Use the core option: `Quick Menu > Core Options > RetroPad Port`
- Bring up the virtual keyboard with `Select` button, and press the key labeled `JOYP`
- Press the default keyboard shortcut `Right Control`
- Assign `Switch Joyport` to any RetroPad button under `Quick Menu > Core Options`
- Rename the game, eg. `Bruce_Lee_j1.tap` or `Bruce_Lee_(j1).tap` for port 1, and similarly `Bruce_Lee_j2.tap` or `Bruce_Lee_(j2).tap` for port 2
- Add `-j1` or `-j2` parameters in custom command line `.cmd`

## M3U support and disk control

When you have a multi disk game, you can use a M3U playlist file to be able to change disks via RetroArch "Disc Control" interface.

A M3U file is a simple text file with one disk per line ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U)).

Example:

`Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems).m3u`
```
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side A)(Game).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side B)(Surface).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side A)(Dungeon).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side B)(Populace A).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side A)(Populace B).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side B)(Populace C).d64
```

Path can be absolute or relative to the location of the M3U file.

When the game asks for it, you can change the current disk in the RetroArch "Disc Control" menu:

- Eject the current disk with "Eject Disc"
- Select the right disk index with "Current Disc Index"
- Insert the new disk with "Insert Disc"

By default, RetroArch will display the filename (without extension) of each M3U entry when selecting a disk via the `Current Disc Index` drop-down menu. Custom display labels may be set for each disk using the syntax: `DISK_FILE|DISK_LABEL`. For example, the following M3U file:

`Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems).m3u`
```
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side A)(Game).d64|Game
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side B)(Surface).d64|Surface
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side A)(Dungeon).d64|Dungeon
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side B)(Populace A).d64|Populace A
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side A)(Populace B).d64|Populace B
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side B)(Populace C).d64|Populace C
```

...will be shown in RetroArch's disk selection menu as:

```
1: Game
2: Surface
3: Dungeon
4: Populace A
5: Populace B
6: Populace C
```

If `DISK_LABEL` is intentionally left blank (i.e. `DISK_FILE|`) then only the disk index will be displayed.

For games that require a dedicated save disk, one may be generated automatically by entering the following line in an M3U file: `#SAVEDISK:VolumeName`. `VolumeName` is optional and may be omitted. For example, this will create a blank, unlabelled disk image at disk index 5:

`Elite (1985)(Firebird Software).m3u`
```
Elite (1985)(Firebird Software).d64
#SAVEDISK:
```

Although one save disk is normally sufficient, an arbitrary number of `#SAVEDISK:VolumeName` lines may be included. Save disks are located in the frontend's save directory, with the following name: `[M3U_FILE_NAME].save[DISK_INDEX].d64`.

Save disks generated by the `#SAVEDISK:` keyword are automatically assigned the label: `Save Disk [SAVE_DISK_INDEX]`.

### Extra features

- `#COMMAND:<commands>`
    - Pass arguments to VICE (place first, core name can be skipped)
- `#SAVEDISK:<label>`
    - Create a save disk in `saves`
- `#LABEL:<label>`
    - Alternative label for the next entry
- `<disk>.d64:<prg>`
    - Load a program instead of `"*"`
- `<disk>.d64|<label>`
    - Set a friendly name (shown in "Disc Control")
- `<disks>.zip#<disk>.d64`
    - Specify a disk inside a ZIP with multiple disks (not needed with single file ZIPs)

M3U playlist supports disks, tapes, cartridges and programs.

## ZIP support

ZIPs are extracted to a temporary directory in `saves`, bypassing the default frontend extraction.
The temporary directory is emptied but not removed on exit. ZIP is not repacked, which means saves and highscores are lost.

This allows:

- Automatic M3U playlist generation of all files
- The use of zipped images in M3Us

## JiffyDOS support

External ROM files required in `system/vice`:

| Filename                         | Size   | MD5                              |
|----------------------------------|-------:|----------------------------------|
| **JiffyDOS_C64.bin**             |  8 192 | be09394f0576cf81fa8bacf634daf9a2 |
| **JiffyDOS_SX-64.bin**           |  8 192 | f0d3aa7c5a81d1e1d3e8eeda84e9dbbe |
| **JiffyDOS_C128.bin**            | 16 384 | cbbd1bbcb5e4fd8046b6030ab71fc021 |
| **JiffyDOS_1541-II.bin**         | 16 384 | 1b1e985ea5325a1f46eb7fd9681707bf |
| **JiffyDOS_1571_repl310654.bin** | 32 768 | 41c6cc528e9515ffd0ed9b180f8467c0 |
| **JiffyDOS_1581.bin**            | 32 768 | 20b6885c6dc2d42c38754a365b043d71 |

## Custom vicerc

Custom configs can be used globally and per-content for accessing VICE options that do not exist as core options.

Config files are processed first found in this order:
1. `saves/[content].vicerc`
2. `saves/vicerc`
3. `system/vice/vicerc`

All available options are dumped in `system/vice/vicerc-dump-[corename]` for copy-pasteing to actual config.

Options must be after the correct `[corename]` block, for example x64 fast:
```
[C64]
GMod2FlashWrite=0
```

## Command file operation

VICE command line options are supported by placing the desired command line in a text file with `.cmd` file extension. The command line format is as documented in the [VICE manual](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_6.html).

Using this you can overcome limitations of the GUI and set advanced configurations required for running problematic files.


VIC-20 Mega-Cart can be launched via `.cmd`:
```
xvic -cartmega "/path/to/rom/mega-cart-name.rom"
```
**VIC-20 Mega-Cart is supported automatically with NVRAM file directed to `saves`.**


VIC-20 memory expansion can be set via `.cmd`: `-memory (3k/8k/16k/24k/all) / (0/1/2/3/5) / (04/20/40/60/a0)`:
```
xvic -memory 1 "/path/to/rom/some-8k-game.d64"
xvic -memory 8k "/path/to/rom/some-8k-game.d64"
xvic -memory 20 "/path/to/rom/some-8k-game.d64"
```

**VIC-20 memory expansion can be set with filename tags or directory matching:**

- `some game (8k).prg` or `some game [8k].prg` or `/8k/some game.prg`
- `vicdoom (35k).d64`

## Latest features

 Feedback
 --------

 It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE, but please
 read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the team.

 - Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  Please make sure
   you turn off the "rich text" (HTML) feature.

 - Please don't send any binaries without asking first.

 - Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a bug or a
   problem you cannot solve:

    - the VICE documentation (you should have received it with the main
      distribution--if not, tell us);
      Online version - http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_toc.html

    - the VICE wiki at http://vice-emu.pokefinder.org/

 - Before reporting a bug, please try a recent nightly build and check if your
   issue is already fixed. You can fine nightly builds for windows here:
   <SF-uploads via Travis-CI?>

 - When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and describe
   how it can be reproduced to the very detail. You should also tell us what
   machine you are running on, what operating system you are using as well as
   the version of Vice.

 - Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to your PC. To
   transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander (http://sta.c64.org/sc.html).

 - Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the Internet.

 - Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we really
   don't know. We are trying to make at least one release per year, around
   christmas.

 - Please write in English.

 In any case, we would be really glad to receive your comments about VICE.

 The central place for bug reports is the bug tracker at sourceforge:
 https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/bugs/

 At sourceforge you can also submit feature requests:
 https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/feature-requests/
